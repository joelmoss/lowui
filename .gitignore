# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/playground/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/playground/log/*
/playground/tmp/*
!/playground/log/.keep
!/playground/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/playground/tmp/pids/*
!/playground/tmp/pids/
!/playground/tmp/pids/.keep


/playground/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/playground/config/master.key
